## Communication and Interpersonal Effectiveness
My communication skills have been shaped by various hands-on experiences. From student-athlete tutoring to my internship in an engineering department at Daimler Truck North America, I have successfully adapted my communication style to suit different learning preferences, experience levels, and knowledge in the area. 

As a student-athlete tutor, I worked one-on-one with student-athletes to support their academic success in classes like INFO 3140. This past summer, I collaborated with cross-functional teams as an Engineering Data Analytics Intern at Daimler Truck North America. In this role, I worked alongside engineers and business stakeholders to develop interactive Tableau dashboards, which required translating complex data insights into clear, actionable visuals. Whether presenting to a technical team or communicating with a peer, I’ve learned how to communicate effectively to move ideas forward and make an impact.

## Community Engagement and Leadership
Community engagement has been one of the most rewarding parts of my college experience. Not just for what I’ve learned, but for the opportunity to help others succeed and contribute to causes bigger than myself. In my junior year, I was a peer mentor for Equity in STEM. I directly supported two first-year students navigating the challenges of rigorous academic programs while being from an underrepresented community. I met with them regularly to provide guidance, share resources, and create a supportive environment that encouraged persistence in STEM fields. This role has taught me the value of showing up consistently for others and the impact of small actions on someone’s academic journey.

Currently, I serve as the Logistics Chair for the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE), where I coordinate events and organize travel for our national conference. This role has helped me build leadership and organizational skills while contributing to an inclusive space for professional and cultural development.

In addition to these leadership positions, I have worked as a research assistant in a biology lab on campus since my freshman. The lab primarily looks at the evolution of reproductive traits through cricket populations. While the work was rooted in biology, I was able to apply my background in data analytics by helping with database organization, data visualization R, and contributing to the overall research process. It was a unique opportunity to bridge disciplines and support meaningful scientific work using my own technical strengths. Across all of these experiences, I’ve learned how to lead with empathy, collaborate across fields, and contribute to the public good in both academic and community settings.

## Critical Thinking
Critical thinking has been essential in helping me bridge the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world problem-solving. During my IT internship at The Club at Las Campanas, I stepped into an unfamiliar environment with limited experience beyond a few computer science courses. I was challenged to quickly learn technical concepts related to networking, POS systems, and Help Desk operations. The key to my success was asking the right questions, seeking guidance from experienced team members, and always striving to understand how each individual task contributed to the larger IT infrastructure. This experience taught me the value of curiosity and big-picture thinking when tackling problems with limited prior knowledge.

At Daimler Truck North America, I faced a different challenge. I had to learn how to use Tableau Prep, a tool I had never used before, to create a clean and sustainable data flow for a stakeholder dashboard. I had to analyze complex data sources, synthesize information from multiple inputs, and design a process that was not only accurate but scalable for future use. It pushed me to think critically about data quality, business needs, and user experience, all while learning a new tool on the job. These experiences taught me that strong critical thinking is less about having all the answers upfront and more about being resourceful, analytical, and adaptable when faced with new and evolving problems.

## Ethical Decision Making
Ethical decision-making is a cornerstone of strong leadership. Through the Daniels curriculum, I participated in the Ethics Bootcamp. This was a two-day intensive event where community leaders shared real-world examples of ethical dilemmas in today’s business world. Attending as a sophomore gave me valuable insight into how ethical choices shape businesses and communities. Currently, I’m further developing this lens through my Business for the Public Good course, where we’re exploring the role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles in shaping responsible business practices. These experiences have shown me the importance of considering all stakeholders and thinking beyond short-term outcomes, and they continue to guide the way I approach both academic and professional challenges with integrity.


## Global/Intercultural Competence
My commitment to developing global competence goes beyond simply exploring different cultures. I strive to understand the real-world challenges people face across borders and languages. Taking two-quarters of Spanish gave me a deeper appreciation for the barriers non-English speakers experience in the U.S., especially in academic and professional environments. It opened my eyes to the importance of inclusive communication and the need for patience and empathy in our increasingly globalized world. Currently, I’m enrolled in an International Politics course, which has further expanded my understanding of how global systems interact and influence each other. Through studying political dynamics, international relations, and cultural perspectives, I’ve gained a broader worldview. This will help me approach business decisions and team collaboration with curiosity, respect, and a commitment to equity. These experiences have helped me recognize that diverse voices and backgrounds are not only valuable but essential in solving today’s complex problems.

## Technical Knowledge

My academic journey at Daniels has equipped me with a robust technical skillset. Through courses such as Foundations of Information Management, Enterprise Information Systems, and Data Mining and Visualization, I have gained hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and programming languages. I’m proficient in Python, SQL, and R, and using development environments like JupyterLab, Visual Studio Code, and RStudio to solve complex data problems. Additionally, I’ve applied these skills to real-world projects—from building interactive dashboards in Tableau to developing regression models—allowing me to transform data into actionable insights. This blend of technical and analytical expertise prepares me for solving diverse business challenges. The following projects are a few that I have worked on throughout my time at Daniels that show off the application of my skills.

For one of my Data Management and Analysis projects, I had to create an infographic using data and statistics to compel a reader to action. <a href="https://jayne-vankirk.github.io/BIA/Infographic.pdf" target="_blank">The Solution to Solving the Organ Shortage </a> gives the audience clear facts, why they should care about this worldwide issue, and what they can do to help solve it.

For my <a href="https://jayne-vankirk.github.io/BIA/Complex_Data_Final_Project.pdf" target="_blank">Complex Data Analytics Final Project</a>, we used an Amazon Reviews dataset and performed various text analyses. Our analysis using topic modeling revealed the most relevant terms for prevalent topics in the reviews.

For my <a href="https://jayne-vankirk.github.io/BIA/Sports_Analytics_Final_Blog_VanKirk.html" target="_blank">Sports Analytics Final Project</a>, I wanted to determine if high team performance is correlated with larger attendance for the 2023 NBA season. I coded a regression model in R to look at team statistics to predict average home attendance for games. 


<img src="https://github.com/jayne-vankirk/images/blob/main/OptimizationModeling.png" height="300"/>
For my <a href="https://jayne-vankirk.github.io/BIA/Optimization_Final_Project.html" target="_blank">Optimization Modeling Final Project</a>, I had to choose the optimal lineup of a fantasy football team in order to maximize fantasy football points. I coded the problem in Python and the graph shows the comparison of total fantasy points based on the four strategies I used to create the models.
