# My Hobbies

Welcome to the page where I share some of my personal interests and passions!

## Snowboarding

Snowboarding is one of my favorite outdoor activities. I picked it up when I moved to Denver for school! Whether it's carving through powder or enjoying scenic mountain views, snowboarding is a thrilling way to stay active and connected to nature.

## Meet Jonesy

Jonesy is my beloved cat! He's a curious, playful companion who loves attention and cuddles. Whether he's lounging on the couch or chasing after toys, he brings joy to my everyday life.

## Crocheting

Crocheting is a hobby Iâ€™ve picked up recently, and it's become a great way to relax and get creative. Crocheting cozy blankets allows me to unwind while creating something special with my hands.
